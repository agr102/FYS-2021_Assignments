# FYS-2021_Assignments

This repository contains all relevant information for the FYS-2021 Machine Learning course. In this repository, I will upload my code, data used in the code, problem set, and report regarding the process of solving problems. All the explanations for the code will be presented in the code itself and the report.

# Assignment 1. Deadline 08/09/2024 23:59

In this assignment, we worked with the dataset from Spotify, which contains various features of songs. Our main goal was to create a model to help us automatically classify a song using its known features. For example, we will observe Pop music and Classical music with its liveness and loudness features. In the first part of the assignment, I made three plots, where I separated Pop and Classical from other genres by representing samples and putting them on the "liveness vs loudness" plot. In addition for easier understanding of the result, I made two plots for each needed genre alone. In the second part of the assignment, I tried to model the Stochastic gradient descent function and regression line for "Liveness vs Loudness" plots. In the last part of the assignment, we will work with the confusion matrix.
